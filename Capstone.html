      on twitch.tv (a livestreaming website) with over 200,000 viewers during big tournaments. The game has been played on huge stages like the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.

      <h1>How is a 15 year old Nintendo game played competitively?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">That is what this website is for, to answer that question </h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Over the first years of the games lifespan, people began to take the game seriously.
      A community began to form as tournaments sprouted out of community members houses, basements, and rented venues.
    As members of the community took the game more seriously, advanced techniuques were found to advances the games skill ceiling.
    These advanced techniques were hidden from the casual fanbase of the game, but the competitive community fully embraced them and used them in their games.
    The game is so unique in the world of fighting games that the sequels of Melee (Brawl, Smash 4) did not kill the game's community off so the game lived throughout the years.</p>
