<!-- Header -->
<header class="w3-container w3-red w3-center" style="padding:100px 16px">
  <h1 class="w3-margin w3-jumbo w3-text-white">Top Tier Characters</h1>
  <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-white">Ranks 1-10</p>
</header>

<!--Fox-->
<div class="w3-third w3-center w3-padding-large">
      <h1>#1 Fox</h1>
        <img src="http://smashlounge.com/img/chars/fox-banner.png" alt="Smiley face">
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Fox is easily the most agile character in the game. His speed and combo setups are optimized when paired with SHFFLing and proper use of the shine (down B). Fox is ranked #1 for a good reason, having one of the strongest up-smashes, unmatched speed and close range fighting, as well as the infamous shine</p>
  </div>

<!--Falco-->
<div class="w3-third w3-center w3-padding-large">
      <h1>#2 Falco</h1>
        <img src="http://smashlounge.com/img/chars/falco-banner.png" alt="Smiley face">
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Falco is an aggressive character whose primary strategy is to pressure the opponent. Falco's vertical mobility is possibly the best in the game. Additionally by using his 'short hop laser', he can control space horizontally, opening up his opponents for high pressure combos.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Marth-->
  <div class="w3-third w3-center w3-padding-large">
        <h1>#3 Marth</h1>
          <img src="http://smashlounge.com/img/chars/marth-banner.png" alt="Smiley face">
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Marth has the most range of anyone in the game. Being one of the few characters that wields a sword, his hitboxes extend very far out, making his defense game great. Marth is a unique character in that his attacks have different hitboxes based on where you hit with the sword (hilt = weak hit, middle = regular hit, tip = strong hit).</p>
    </div>

    <!--Sheik-->
    <div class="w3-third w3-center w3-padding-large">
          <h1>#4 Sheik</h1>
            <img src="http://smashlounge.com/img/chars/sheik-banner.png" alt="Smiley face">
          <p class="w3-text-grey">Sheik is one of the deadliest characters in the game. Although she does not have a ton of offensive options, she makes up for it with her defense and simple, yet highly effective combo game. Sheik's main assets are her tilts, grab combos, and infamous forward-air</p>
      </div>

    <!--Falcon-->
    <div class="w3-third w3-center w3-padding-large">
          <h1>#5 Falcon</h1>
            <img src="http://smashlounge.com/img/chars/captainfalcon-banner.png" alt="Smiley face">
          <p class="w3-text-grey">Falcon is the fastest character in the game in terms of run speed. His speed allows him to be many places at once, and though most of his moves are slow on startup, he makes up for it with his unmatched speed. Falcon's main combo finisher is the infamous knee (forward air) as it combos from many of his moves and kills at low percents.  </p>
      </div>

    <!--jigglypuff-->
    <div class="w3-third w3-center w3-padding-large">
          <h1>#6 Jigglypuff</h1>
            <img src="http://smashlounge.com/img/chars/jigglypuff-banner.png" alt="Smiley face">
          <p class="w3-text-grey">Being the 2nd lightest character in the game, Jigglypuff is prone to dying at low percents. Although this is a disadvantage, her elusiveness in the air paired with some of the best aerial attacks in the game makes her a powerful character. Jigglypuff has 5 jumps and is able to float back on to the stage with ease, making recovery very simple..  </p>
      </div>

      <!--Ice Climbers-->
      <div class="w3-third w3-center w3-padding-large">
            <h1>#7 Ice Climbers</h1>
              <img src="http://smashlounge.com/img/chars/iceclimbers-banner.png" alt="Smiley face">
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The Ice Climbers is a character in which the player controls Popo (blue IC depending on costume color), while Nana follows and mimics Popo's inputs with a slight delay. The main strategy with Ice Climbers is abusing their grab combos, as they can kill off of most grabs. Strategies change constantly with IC's based on if your Nana is present or not.  </p>
        </div>

        <!--Ice Climbers-->
        <div class="w3-third w3-center w3-padding-large">
              <h1>#8 Peach</h1>
                <img src="http://smashlounge.com/img/chars/peach-banner.png" alt="Smiley face">
              <p class="w3-text-grey">Peach is one of the most unique floaty characters in the game because of her float mechanics. By using a technique called 'float cancelling' Peach is able to suspend herself in mid air and move horizontally, using any aerial attack. Landing lag after float cancelling is reduced, making her have one of the fastest recovery times on attacks</p>
          </div>

        <!--Ice Climbers-->
        <div class="w3-third w3-center w3-padding-large">
              <h1>#9 Pikachu</h1>
                <img src="http://smashlounge.com/img/chars/pikachu-banner.png" alt="Smiley face">
              <p class="w3-text-grey">Pikachu is pretty much the mid-tier Fox. They share many qualities such as quick combo game, ability to run around on the stage, powerful up smash, and linear recovery. Also like Fox, Pikachu is capable of getting kills at high percent with up smash, as well as low percent kills with up-air. Pikachu is a character that thrives in using quick and weak moves to rack up percent or set up for edge guard situations. </p>
          </div>


          <!--Padding-->
          <div class="w3-third w3-center w3-padding-large">
                <h1></h1>

                <p class="w3-text-grey"> </p>
            </div>

          <!--Samus-->
          <div class="w3-third w3-center w3-padding-large">
                <h1>#10 Samus</h1>
                  <img src="http://smashlounge.com/img/chars/samus-banner.png" alt="Smiley face">
                <p class="w3-text-grey">Samus is a very linear character, as many of her hitboxes only extend out in straight lines. Although Samus is one of the slowest characters in the game, her defense and control of the pace in the match allow her to be a viable defensive character. Samus can control wide ranges of space by using missile cancelling-- and can control close range with her up-b and tilts. </p>
