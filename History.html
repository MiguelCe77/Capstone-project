        <h1>The Early Game</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">2001  - 2005</h5>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">Tournaments in this era were extremely informal, and usually were hosted out of people's basements, or the occasional game store.  There was a dispute over the "official" ruleset between regions, but the dispute eventually settled on a more or less central ruleset.  There were constantly new techniques discovered, including the likes of "wavedashing", "L-Canceling", "chaingrabs", "dash dancing" and more!  Match up knowledge was evolving and developing at a rapid pace, with single new strategies having the ability to unravel the entire gameplan of the opposing player, unable to adapt to something they had never seen before!

        This is the era when legendary Marth player "Ken" rose to be #1 in the world by attending and winning nearly every single major Melee tournament world wide and besting the strongest players around such as Azen, Bombsoldier, Captain Jack, Isai, and more.</p>

        <h1>The Golden Age</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32 ">2006 - 2007</h5>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">MLG had started to put a lot of focus on Melee, hosting several huge tournaments with hefty prizes for the winners to collect.  In this age several players rose to meet Ken's skill level, including PC Chris, Chu Dat, and Mew2King.  After winning EVO2007, Ken dropped out of attending any more Melee tournaments, having felt burnt out from being treated as a villain all the time.

The highest levels of the game saw more consistent technical application, some pretty hefty punishes, and aggressive play.

This was the era where our community became much more well known online through MLG's exposure.  Memes such as "No items. Fox Only. Final Destination." and other jokes at our community's expense were much more wide spread.  Casual players accused us of playing the game wrong, that we were taking all the fun out of the game.  Complaints that wave dashing and tier lists were breaking the game and/or cheating became mainstream, although many of those making such claims had no idea what they were talking about.</p>

          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">2008 - 2009</h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">2008 started out extremely strong, as a breakout player "Mango" started making waves among the top players after winning "Pound 3" after taking out top player after top player and claiming the #1 spot in the tournament.  The best player in Europe, "Armada", had come state side for GENESIS, and put on an impressive display of force with Peach that had never been seen before.  There were plenty of players moving up and getting better, hoping to keep the momentum going through the release of Super Smash Brothers Brawl. But that wasn't what happened.

Traditionally in fighting game communities, when a new game in a series comes out, the entire community is "supposed to" shift gears and pick up the new game as the "main game".  However, Brawl played nothing like Melee, and was developed and released at the height of Nintendo's aim to appease casual and new game players and pay no attention to the hardcore or competitive players.</p>

          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">2010 - 2012</h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">A tournament series titled "Revival of Melee", was aiming to do just what it says.  In late 2009, the tournament managed to gather together the upper echelon of players from every generation and successfully begin to usher in a new era of Melee prosperity.  Much of the success of this tournament is attributed to the fabled "M2k vs Shiz 4" match, which highlights probably more than any other match just how difficult a game Melee is. The Revival Era ends with the same tournament series it began with.  The scene became complacent after it avoided extinction, and a huge controversy erupted over collusion and rule confusion at Revival Of Melee 5.  As a result of the community outrage, prominent members of the community banded together to form the podcast "Melee It On Me" (MIOM) in order to focus the community and organize it around one ruleset and make sure everyone was on the same page.

          <h1>The Early Platinum Age</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">2013 - 2014</h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">With the revival going in full force and drawing in ever-increasing numbers to the scene, a few key events set the Platinum Age apart from the rest of history.

Starting with the release of the "Smash Doc" in October 2013, a 9-part documentary series providing an entertaining look back at the history of the game and the top players, gaining major popularity all around the internet, many people started flooding to the scene in search of finding out for themselves what all these players are devoting their lives to.  This also drew in the interest of organizations such as MLG, Team Liquid, and more.  With the guidance of MIOM, sponsors got in contact with top players new and old and began bringing more money into the scene. Around the same time, the Evolution Fighting Game Tournament Series (EVO) put up a poll on their Facebook page, asking what people would like to see as the 8th game featured on their 2013 stage.  The results were a landslide in SSBM's favor.  Suspicious of the results, the heads of EVO then changed the poll to a charity drive, and whatever scene donated the most to Breast Cancer Awareness would be the 8th featured game.  The Melee community, with some help from other Nintendo gaming communities, came out in full force, raising $94,683, putting it ahead of Skullgirls ($78,760) and Super Street Fighter 2: Turbo ($39, 567).  Melee EXPLODED following this event.  Where 100 man regionals every couple of months on weekends used to be common, we now saw WEEKLY tournaments during weekdays getting anywhere between 60 to 100 people.  Multiple tournaments that did not think they would be very large started having issues when an additional 150 people would show up unexpectedly.  This huge growth lead to the crown jewel of the Platinum Age, "The Summer Of Smash".</p>

          <h1>Platinum Age</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">2015 - Present</h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">Sponsors kept adding more and more players to their rosters, and the game was exploding as fast as ever. As usual, the results of this APEX shook up the Melee scene again.  PPMD, although not having made much of an appearance since EVO2014, showed up and dominated the entire event with no small thanks to his precise and controlled Marth play.  Armada's Fox had continued to level up, and along with his Peach netted him a 2nd place finish.  Leffen finished 3rd, but only after finally taking a game off of Mew2King, making Leffen the first player to have taken a set off of each "god" of Melee, firmly rooting Leffen within everyone's "Top 6" rankings. After Melee was confirmed to be part of EVO2015, and weeks later was confirmed to have surpassed APEX2015's registration numbers, the hype has been steadily rising as we have no idea where that entrant count will stop, but estimates have put it close to 2000 entrants.  There have been a handful of major events since APEX leading up to EVO so far, including "I'm Not Yelling" and "MVG Sandstorm".</p>
