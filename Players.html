      <p class="w3-text-grey">Armada is a Melee player from Sweden who mains Peach and Fox in Melee. Armada is currently ranked 1st on the 2017 and 2016 SSBMRank and the European Melee Power Rankings and as such is widely considered to be the best Melee player in the world. He is also considered the greatest Peach player of all time, showcasing outstanding skill for many years with a character still considered to be subpar compared to other top tiers. In addition to his legacy as one of the "Five Gods" of Melee, Armada is considered to be one of the greatest Melee players of all time.</p>

He is a Melee God and widely considered to be one of the top five players in the world (along with Armada, Mango, Mew2King, and Leffen) and widely considered to be the greatest Jigglypuff player of all time. Hungrybox is notorious for his defensive playstyle, relying heavily on Jigglypuff's ability to weave through opponents in the air and set up blockades with several consecutive and well placed back aerials. </p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Mew2King, commonly known as M2K, is an American smasher from Cinnaminson, New Jersey, who is currently residing in Florida. He started playing competitively and attending tournaments in 2005 for Melee and 2008 for Brawl, and has worked up a reputation of being one of the best Melee and Brawl players in the world due to his great chaingrabbing, camping, and comboing skills, as well as his extremely optimal, technical, and intelligent play style, earning him the nickname The Robot. Mew2King is the highest grossing Smash player and considered to be the best player over all Smash games, and as such, he is widely considered to be the most iconic Smash player of all time, recognizable to the internet, and virtually the whole video game community worldwide.

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Leffen is a professional smasher from Stockholm, Sweden. He is currently considered to be one of the best Melee players in the world along with Armada, Hungrybox, Mango, and Mew2King. He started off as a Falco main, but later switched to Fox, and is now known as one of the most technical Fox players in the world. He is the only player in competitive Melee history to have taken a set off of each of the Five Gods and has often been called a god himself since his ascent in 2014.

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Mango (often stylized as Mang0) is a top professional Melee player from Norwalk, California. Mango was widely considered everywhere to be #1 best Fox player in the world, though this was before the emergence of the Swedish smashers Armada and Leffen. Thus, he is widely considered to be the best NTSC Fox of all time, and one of the two best Falco players in the world (along with Westballz).
